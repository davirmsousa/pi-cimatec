# pi-cimatec

This interdisciplinary project (did) coded by a group in discipline Application Programming.
We think in a form to improve the life of blind persons. One of the amount of problems they have is the difficulty to move in places with a lot of peoples.
To solve this we create the "ISEE" gadget. It is compound of glasses with cams to capt images and identify fixed obstacles (plant vases, walls, chairs...) or mobile obstacles (persons, kids, pets...), a belt with 4-8 vibrators to vibate and give a security way for the user follow and a CPU to interpret data from glasses, control the vibrators and calc the smaller path.
Our idea is this working in closed places with a matrix map registered, then the CPU (we think to use Arduino) can get the map and calc the smaller path.
Obviously, the gadget wont be builded, it is only an idea implemented in a simple C project.
